        <p>The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, comprising vocalist Jim Morrison,
            keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most
            influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, primarily due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along
            with his erratic stage persona and legal issues. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the
            era's counterculture.[4] </p>
        <p>The band took its name from the title of the English writer Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception,
            itself a reference to a quote by the English poet William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records in 1966,
            the Doors with Morrison recorded and released six studio albums in five years, some of which are generally
            considered among the greatest of all time,[5][6] including their debut The Doors (1967), Strange Days
            (1967), and L.A. Woman (1971). Dubbed the "Kings of Acid Rock",[7] they were one of the most successful
            bands of their time and by 1972, the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million
            singles.[8]
