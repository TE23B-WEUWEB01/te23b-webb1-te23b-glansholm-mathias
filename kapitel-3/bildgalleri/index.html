                <p>During the total solar eclipse, the Sun’s corona, only visible during the total eclipse, is shown as
                    a
                    crown of white flares from the surface. The red spots called Bailey's beads occurs where the moon
                    grazes
                    by the Sun and the rugged lunar limb topography allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some
                    areas

                <p>NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) recently captured a unique view of Earth from the
                    spacecraft's
                    vantage point in orbit around the moon. "The image is simply stunning," said Noah Petro, Deputy
                    Project
                    Scientist for LRO at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "The image of the
                    Earth
                    evokes the famous 'Blue Marble' image taken by Astronaut Harrison Schmitt during Apollo 17, 43 years
                    ago, which also showed Africa prominently in the picture." In this composite image we see Earth
                    appear
                    to rise over the lunar horizon from the viewpoint of the spacecraft, with the center of the Earth
                    just
                    off the coast of Liberia (at 4.04 degrees North, 12.44 degrees West). The large tan area in the
                    upper
                    right is the Sahara Desert, and just beyond is Saudi Arabia. The Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
                    South
                    America are visible to the left. On the moon, we get a glimpse of the crater Compton, which is
                    located
                    just beyond the eastern limb of the moon, on the lunar farside. LRO was launched on June 18, 2009,
                    and
                    has collected a treasure trove of data with its seven powerful instruments, making an invaluable
                    contribution to our knowledge about the moon. LRO experiences 12 earthrises every day; however the
                    spacecraft is almost always busy imaging the lunar surface so only rarely does an opportunity arise
                    such
                    that its camera instrument can capture a view of Earth. Occasionally LRO points off into space to
                    acquire observations of the extremely thin lunar atmosphere and perform instrument calibration
                    measurements. During these movements sometimes Earth (and other planets) pass through the camera's
                    field
                    of view and dramatic images such as the one shown here are acquired. This image was composed from a
                    series of images taken Oct. 12, when LRO was about 83 miles (134 kilometers) above the moon's
                    farside
                    crater Compton. Capturing an image of the Earth and moon with LRO's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
                    Camera
                    (LROC) instrument is a complicated task. First the spacecraft must be rolled to the side (in this
                    case
                    67 degrees), then the spacecraft slews with the direction of travel to maximize the width of the
                    lunar
                    horizon in LROC's Narrow Angle Camera image. All this takes place while LRO is traveling faster than
                    3,580 miles per hour (over 1,600 meters per second) relative to the lunar surface below the
                    spacecraft!
                    The high-resolution Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) on LRO takes black-and-white images, while the lower
                    resolution Wide Angle Camera (WAC) takes color images, so you might wonder how we got a
                    high-resolution
                    picture of the Earth in color. Since the spacecraft, Earth, and moon are all in motion, we had to do
                    some special processing to create an image that represents the view of the Earth and moon at one
                    particular time. The final Earth image contains both WAC and NAC information. WAC provides the
                    color,
                    and the NAC provides high-resolution detail. "From the Earth, the daily moonrise and moonset are
                    always
                    inspiring moments," said Mark Robinson of Arizona State University in Tempe, principal investigator
                    for
                    LROC. "However, lunar astronauts will see something very different: viewed from the lunar surface,
                    the
                    Earth never rises or sets. Since the moon is tidally locked, Earth is always in the same spot above
                    the
                    horizon, varying only a small amount with the slight wobble of the moon. The Earth may not move
                    across
                    the 'sky', but the view is not static. Future astronauts will see the continents rotate in and out
                    of
                    view and the ever-changing pattern of clouds will always catch one's eye, at least on the nearside.
                    The
                    Earth is never visible from the farside; imagine a sky with no Earth or moon - what will farside
                    explorers think with no Earth overhead?" NASA's first Earthrise image was taken with the Lunar
                    Orbiter 1
                    spacecraft in 1966. Perhaps NASA's most iconic Earthrise photo was taken by the crew of the Apollo 8
                    mission as the spacecraft entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve Dec. 24, 1968. That evening, the
                    astronauts -- Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot
                    William
                    Anders -- held a live broadcast from lunar orbit, in which they showed pictures of the Earth and
                    moon as
                    seen from their spacecraft. Said Lovell, "The vast loneliness is awe-inspiring and it makes you
                    realize
                    just what you have back there on Earth." Credit: NASA/Goddard/Arizona State University NASA image
